There are 5 subwindows displayed by gitk.
Top Left:
This subwindow displays the history of the repository in a tree like structure. Here we can see all the commits, merges, and
branches. Next to every commit is the commit message.

Top Middle:
This subwindow shows the person who made the commit and their email.

Top Right:
This window shows the time and date of the commit.

Bottom Left:
This subwindow contains detailed information about the commit. It also shows the diff for the file displaying all the changes that
have been made to the file for that specific commit. We are given information about what commit came before and what comes after.

Bottom Right:
This subwindow displays all the files that have been changed in the selected commit. When we click on the different files, we can
see the diffs before and after the commit. This is for patch mode. When we toggle tree mode, we can see a snapshot of the repository
during that point.
