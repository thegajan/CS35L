Assignment 1



1. The shell command "man -k word" where "word" is the keyword being searched prints all the commands that have "word" in their man page. The solution was found using the hint.

2. The mv is located in /usr/local/cs/bin/ and sh is located in /usr/bin/. This was found by using the "which" command (which mv and which sh).

3. The executable programs that are two characters long and end in r are:
pr - convert text files for printing
tr - translate or delete characters
The programs were found using "find /usr/bin/ -name '?r'". Used man pages to find out what each program did.

4. When you execute the command named by the symbolic link /usr/bin/emacs, /etc/alternatives/emacs is executed. This was found by "ls /usr/bin -l | grep emacs".

5. The version number of the /usr/bin/gcc program is 4.8.5. The version number of the plain gcc program is 8.2.0. This was found by doing /usr/bin/gcc --version and /usr/local/cs/bin/gcc --version. They are different copies of gcc located in different directories and can therefore have different version numbers.

6. In class we learned that u stands for user, so u+sx sets the user ID on execution and gives the user execution permission. We also learned that o stands for other, so o-w means remove write permission for others on the file. Information for this question was found in the slides.

7. Using "find . -type d -ctime -28" from /usr/local/cs and /usr/local/ the directories I found are:
/bin
/.del
/coreutils-8.30
/ocaml-4.07.0
/cs
/.snapshot
/share
/jdk-11
/gdb-8.2
The -type d option only checks for directories and -28 checks for 4 weeks. I found this on the man pages.

8. There are 252 symbolic link files in the same directory as find. I first found what directory find was in using "which find". I then found out how many symbolic links by using "find /usr/bin/ -type l | wc". This finds all the symbolic link files and then pipes it to wc which counts the number of newlines.

9. The oldest file in the directory is librom1394.so.0.3.0. This was found by doing "ls -lt" in the /usr/lib64 directory.

10. The locale command gets its data from the environmental variables. This was found by looking at the man page for locale.

11. The emacs commands that have downcase in their name are:
downcase-dwim
downcase-region
downcase-word
This was done by launching emacs and typing C-h a downcase.

12. C-M-r does incremental search backward for regular expression.
C-M-v scroll next window upward ARG lines.
This was found by doing C-h b to find all the keybinds and their functions.

13. C-g quits a command before it finishes executing. It sets the quit-flag to t the moment that the bind is pressed. I found this by doing C-h b and C-s to find all the keybinds and search.

14. The emacs function yank reinserts the last stretch of killed text. You can easily invoke this using C-y. I found this by typing C-h b yank.

15. The difference between ls -l and dired are the first 3 lines of the output. Dired outputs:
total used in directory 294900 available 13089376
dr-xr-xr-x. 2  root root     69632 Oct  2 15:23 .
drwxr-xr-x. 15 root root      4096 May 22 07:49 ..
So dired also outputs the parent and current working directory whereas ls -l does not.
